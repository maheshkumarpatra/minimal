### Bank Case Study(Should you get the loan? Will you pay the loan on time?)

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying
their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan,
reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
